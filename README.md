# Vaccination-Distribution-Effects-on-Infection-Rates-in-Maryland

Project 2 Proposal and Summary <br>
Project 2 Name: Vaccination Distribution Effects on Infection Rates in Maryland<br>
Project 2 Team: Juan Castaneda, Robin Evans, Clayton Grace

Purpose/Scope:

1. Discover vaccine availability over time in Maryland
2. Demonstrate effects of vaccine distribution on infection rates within Maryland
3. Identify vaccination sites within MD
4. Data customization based on region, date, and population

The purpose of this project is to communicate the effects of vaccinations on infection rates in the state of Maryland. The “story” that will be told through this data is that vaccination distribution and the rate of infection are inversely proportional, i.e. as vaccination rates increase infection rates decrease. With increasing vaccination rates, State leaders are wrestling with decisions about restrictions and health orders. This project intends to assist the decision-making process by providing clarity on vaccination rates, infection rates, and the relationship between the two over time. A customizable dashboard will be created that summarizes the data utilizing several visualizations. The dashboard will be able to be customized by county, date, and population.

Data Sources, Visualizations, and Tools:

The data sources for this project will use COVID data sets from The Maryland Department of Health (https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/search). The visualizations for this project will include, at a minimum, 1.) graphic depictions of vaccination rates and infection rates, 2.) an interactive map of counties with detailed pop-ups, and 3.) a heat map of the state depicting vaccination and infection densities. The data will be stored in a SQL database and visualizations will be created using the React library for JavaScript.
